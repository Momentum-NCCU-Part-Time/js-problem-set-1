// Create a function called isOdd that, given a number, will
// return true if it is odd and false if it is not. An odd number is a
// number which, when divided by 2, has a remainder of 1 or -1.

//  Create a function called isEven that, given a number, will
// return true if it is even and false if it is not. An even number is a
// number which, when divided by 2, has a remainder of 0.

// Create a function called lesser that takes two numbers as
// arguments and returns the lesser of them. This function should
// use an if/else statement.
