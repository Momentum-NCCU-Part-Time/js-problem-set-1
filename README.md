# JavaScript Practice

## Directions

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. Run all the tests with `npm test`. Or, run the tests for a single file with `npm test <path-to-test-file>`. For example, `npm test test/variables.test`.
3. Make the tests pass by writing code in the corresponding file.
